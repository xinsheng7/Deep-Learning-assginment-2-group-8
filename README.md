# Deep-Learning-assginment-2-group-8

## Introduction
This project investigates the performance and stability of **Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN)** and **Conditional Deep Convolutional GANs (cDCGAN)**.  
Our goal is to re-implement both architectures, evaluate them on multiple datasets, and analyze the impact of various conditioning methods, loss functions, and training-stabilization techniques.  
The work is carried out as part of a research-based group assignment.

## Model & Experiment Data

The trained models, experiment dashboards, and the compiled W&B results table are stored externally to keep this repository lightweight.

### Google Drive (Models & Excel)
All files are in the same folder:
- **Trained Models (.pth)**
- **Wandb Table (cGAN cDCGAN).xlsx**

[Access Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KO4iVEWiyViDP9GXIWt1SSZ2Cyy2f-fy?usp=drive_link)

> *Note:* Files will remain available until the end of the trimester.
